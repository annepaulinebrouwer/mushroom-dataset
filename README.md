<pre>
  In this assignment the following dataset it used:
  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom

  Via this app it is possible to filter out mushrooms that meet specific attributes.
  For example, it is possible to list of all mushrooms that are edible, have a brown gill-color, and two rings. The dataset contains 8124 types of mushrooms, each with 23 different attributes.

  No pagination is added, so only the first 50 results are shown.

  The app can be run locally. To populate the database run `rails db:seed`
